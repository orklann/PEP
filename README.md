# PEP

[PEP](https://macpep.org/) is an acronym for PDF Editing Program (for Mac). It's a free and open source PDF editor for Mac. It is a lightweight alternative to Adobe Acrobat.

For now, PEP is work-in-progress and it's constantly updated everyday.

Currently working on the core, a PDF engine called Gene from scratch.

**PEP is now able to open and edit external PDFs, and save as new PDF.** please check it out in
the [download](https://macpep.org/download) page for alpha version.
